I am a research ecologist at USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Manhattan KS, exploring climate drivers of arthropod-borne livestock disease spread. To tackle this I'm delving into iterative forecasting, movement ecology, and deep learning. Some of my recent work has included leveraging the [Long-Term Ecological Research network](https://lternet.edu/) to ask how [climate change impacts dryland agroecosystems](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab134). My dissertation focused on how the jet stream modulates [tree growth](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2019.125633), [the length of the growing season across the hemisphere](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7553), and eastern monarch butterfly migration.
