I am a climate ecologist and an ORISE postdoc in the [Scientific Computing Initiative Network (SCINet)](https://scinet.usda.gov/) at USDA Agricultural Research Service.  I have a B.S. in Mathematics and an M.S. in Environmental Science from the University of Maryland and earned my Ph.D. in Natural Resources from the University of Arizona where I was also a member of the Laboratory of Tree-ring Research. My dissertation work explored how the jet stream modulates [tree growth](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2019.125633), [growing season phenology](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7553), and monarch butterfly migration.
