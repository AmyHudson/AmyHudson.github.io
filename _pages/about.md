I am a climate ecologist and a postdoc in the [Scientific Computing Initiative Network (SCINet)](https://scinet.usda.gov/) at USDA ARS, with a Ph.D. in Natural Resources from the University of Arizona. My [current research](https://scinet.usda.gov/stories/2021/04/15/Hudson.html) focuses on how climate impacts agro-ecosystems across the globe and the spread of livestock diseases across North America. I thrive in collaborative and interdisciplinary settings, where I contribute: leadership, coding power, and the ability to synthesize research and knowledge gaps.
