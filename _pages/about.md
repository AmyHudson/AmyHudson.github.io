I am a climate-ecosystem scientist and a postdoc in the [Scientific Computing Initiative Network (SCINet)](https://scinet.usda.gov/) at USDA-ARS. I have a PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Arizona. My research examines how climate impacts [dryland ecosystems across the globe and the spread of livestock diseases across North America](https://scinet.usda.gov/stories/2021/04/15/Hudson.html).
