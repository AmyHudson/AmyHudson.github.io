This is Dr. Amy Hudson's home on the web!

I am currently a Scientific Computing Initiative (SCINet) ORISE Postdoctoral fellow with the USDA ARS. I have a PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Arizona. My research examines interactions between climate and ecosystem phenology at broad spatial scales. I am currently investigating the role of circulation patterns in driving the distribution of vector-borne disease (VSV and West Nile) outbreaks across North America.
